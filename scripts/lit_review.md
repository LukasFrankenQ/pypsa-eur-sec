##### The value of in-reservoir energy storage for flexible dispatch of geothermal power

- Basic idea: Confined geothermal reservoir can store accumulated, pressurized geofluid and provide flexible load-following generation.
- This flexible generation increases value of geothermal plants in markets high VRE penetration.
- A particular quality of EGS is that is naturally offers geomechanical energy storage through its low-permeability rock matrix.
- This behaviour was demonstrated by the Fenton Hill test site 
- Basic principle: Periodic reductions in production flow rate with no change in injection rate were shown to results in increased reservour pressure
- Referred to as __in-reservoir energy storage__ (IRES).
- Average cycle efficiency around 80 percent.

##### Mining the Earth's Heat: Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy (Fenton Hill summary)

- thermal power on the order of 4-5 MW
- at 180 degrees, 15 percent efficiency -> 0.5 MW of electricity
- Except in unusual areas where recent faulting hat disturbed the basement rock, the geology similar to Fenton Hill, allowing replication of the Fenton Hill reservoirs at 'tens of thousands of locations'.
- Main 2 takeaways: Central to HDR tech are 1) drilling deep enough for suitable temperatures, and 3) drilling into basement rock that is free of open joints -> better reservoir confinement.
- Rock structures accessed by EGS are harder in nature than the formations drilled into for oil and gas -> little incentive existed for drilling equipment for this setting.
- Backpressure applied to production wellbore induces energy storage
