- Basic idea: Confined geothermal reservoir can store accumulated, pressurized geofluid and provide flexible load-following generation.
- This flexible generation increases value of geothermal plants in markets high VRE penetration.
- A particular quality of EGS is that is naturally offers geomechanical energy storage through its low-permeability rock matrix.
- This behaviour was demonstrated by the Fenton Hill test site 
- Basic principle: Periodic reductions in production flow rate with no change in injection rate were shown to results in increased reservour pressure
- Referred to as __in-reservoir energy storage__ (IRES).
- Average cycle efficiency around 80 percent.

##### Mining the Earth's Heat: Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy (Fenton Hill summary)

- thermal power on the order of 4-5 MW
- at 180 degrees, 15 percent efficiency -> 0.5 MW of electricity
- Except in unusual areas where recent faulting hat disturbed the basement rock, the geology similar to Fenton Hill, allowing replication of the Fenton Hill reservoirs at 'tens of thousands of locations'.
- Main 2 takeaways: Central to HDR tech are 1) drilling deep enough for suitable temperatures, and 3) drilling into basement rock that is free of open joints -> better reservoir confinement.
- Rock structures accessed by EGS are harder in nature than the formations drilled into for oil and gas -> little incentive existed for drilling equipment for this setting.
- Backpressure applied to production wellbore induces energy storage

##### The Role of Flexible Geothermal Power in Decarbonized Electricity Systems - Reader's Digest
*Wilson Ricks, Katharine Voller, Jack Norbeck, Jesse Jenkins*
[working paper reader's digest link](https://zenodo.org/record/7093330#.ZDUdrHZBxPY), paper in under review.

- Flexible EGS enhances the role that EGS plays in the overall system by decreasing bulk electricity supply cost
- Displaces more expensive competing resources by shifting their generation on diurnal and seasonal timescales.
- Round trip efficiencies of 81-98% percent are assumed.
- Robust across a range of electricity market and geothermal tech development scenarios.
- Use software ResFrac to similate operations and map reservoir pressure to flow rates.
- Model captures strong dependence of geothermal power output on local air temperature.
- __Results:__
    - Flexible EGS is competetive even without significant reductions in cost of wellfield or surface plants.
    - Reduction in drilling cost and advanced drilling to access resources at depth of up to 6.5 km are pathway to much greater EGS deployment; 45% of electricity from EGS for regions.
    - shifting generation to high-value times makes a great difference.
    - generation shifted over time scales of days to months.
    - During this, round-trip efficiencies of 81-98% are achieved.

- old conception that EGS would operate as baseload generation
- 11 zones, electricity only, GenX, hourly resolution
- Account for the effect of local ambient temperature on air-cooled geomthermal systems.
- Scenarios tested include EGS getting cheaper, reservoir performance, with and without flexibility, other technologies getting cheaper (market opportunity).
- Strongest to weakest effect of deployment: baseline vs advanced drilling, market opportunity, with or without flexibility, and virtually no effect of reservoir performance. 
- Inflexible EGS is mostly replacing competing clean firm resources such as load-following natural gas plants with CCS, hence is more prevalent in regions with low availability of VRE.
- Inflexible EGS produces more constantly, bit lower during the day
- Flexible EGS produces exclusively during night
- Flexible EGS not only operates on diurnal cycles but also seasonal cycles.
- GeoVision report: EGS plants air-cooled organic rankine cycles.
- No future cost assumptions made: only considered advancement is being able to access hot rock at temperatures > 250 degrees.
- Estimate available potential at depth for relevant region. Compute cost of transmission using Jenkins et al. (see page 14)
- Ambient air temperatures cause variation in capacity factor between 56% and 116%, with lower values during higher temperatures.
- GeoVision report: Technology Advancement could lead to a cost reduction to 3000$/kW
- great discussion of cost assumptions
- change in net power output versus years: goes down to -45% after 30 years, see fig 21 in supplement.
- capacity factor multiplier to due to air temperature between 1.1 and 0.6; determined by: 1) take average yearly temp at each point. This is the temp for which the systems are designed. 2) Take time series of delta between temperature and average temperature, and create capacity factor from data in Figure 20 supplement.

##### The design space for long-duration energy storage in decarbonized power systems.
*Sepulveda et al. 2021* [nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00796-8)

- Evaluates the role of long-duration energy storage in a decarbonized energy system
- Required cost and efficiency to displace firm low-carbon generation.
- Charge and discharge capacity play secondary roles, energy capacity costs must be \leq 20 USD/kWh, to reduce elec cost by >10%.
- must be \leq 1 USD/kWh to fully displace all firm low-carbon generation (i.e. fossil+CCS)
- Electrification of end uses in northern lats is difficult -> makes LDES unlikely to be feasible.
- LDES with most effect have storage durations >100h.
- Great table with cot overview for different storage methods
- electricity system cap expansion model with hourly resolution.
- Tested combinations of five different parameters: 
    - charge power capacity cost
    - discharge power capacity cost
    - energy storage capacity cost
    - charge efficiency
    - discharge efficiency

##### CO2 Emission Mitigation by Geothermal Development - Especially with Geothermal Heat Pumps
*Rybach 2010* [paper](https://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/WGC/2010/0209.pdf)

- Emission for high-temperature geothermal power plants is about 120g/kWh (weighted average of 85 percent of global power plant capacity). (No source named)
- Emission can be reduced through reinjection to 10g/kWh (no source named).
- This is a very bad paper and should not be trusted.

##### Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation 
*IPCC (PIK) 2012* [paper](https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srren/SRREN_FD_SPM_final.pdf)

- From page 74-
    - Env and societal impacts site- and tech-specific
    - main GHG emission emitted from 'naturally occuring resources'.
    - Wildly varying numbers observed in a field survey 2001 between 4 to 740 gCO2/kWhel
    - LCA estimates CO2 equivalent emissions are less than 50 g/kWhel, less than 80 g/kWhel for projected EGS, and between 14 and 202 g/kWh_th for district heating systems and GHPs.

## On induced seismicity 

### __Induced seismicity associated with Enhanced Geothermal Systems__
2007, 800 citations, Majer et al., [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375650507000387)

- "We conclude that EGS-induced seismicity need not pose a threat to the development of geothermal energy resources if site selection is carried out properly, community issues are handled adequately and operators understand the underlying mechanisms causing the events".
- Elaborations on Basel and the Geyers in CA indicate that induced seismicity is more likely in the proximity of faultlines.

### __Review of induced seismicity in geothermal systems worldwide and implications for geothermal systems in the Netherlands__
2019, 45 citations, Buijze et al, [link](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/netherlands-journal-of-geosciences/article/review-of-induced-seismicity-in-geothermal-systems-worldwide-and-implications-for-geothermal-systems-in-the-netherlands/FAF7C70E8F2DAF8DDC18B84B18BF146B)

- "The case study review shows that doublets that circulate fluids through relatively shallow, porous, sedimentary aquifers far from the crystalline basement are unlikely to generate felt seismic events. "
- "On the other hand, stimulations or circulations in or near competent, fractured, basement rocks and production and reinjection operations in high-temperature geothermal fields are more prone to induce felt events, occasionally with magnitudes of M > 5.0."
- "The presence of large, optimally oriented and critically stressed faults increases the potential for induced seismicity."
- [Database of human induced earthquakes.](http://inducedearthquakes.org/)
- Key parameters of induced seismicity: rock type, injection pressure
- Strong induced seismic events have been observed for various types of rock
- "The majority of felt seismic events occurred in geothermal systems in tectonically active, convection-dominated settings, both in hydrothermal systems and petrothermal systems (EGS). Also petrothermal systems in tectonically inactive regions generated felt seismicity. Hot sedimentary aquifers in tectonically inactive, conduction-dominated settings, on the other hand, mostly did not generate felt seismicity, unless operations occurred close to competent (crystalline) basement rocks."
- " Seismicity with M > 2.0 becomes more likely when operations cause stress changes on critically stressed faults (which are often found in the crystalline basement), or when stress perturbations are transmitted from sedimentary formations to the crystalline basement, e.g. if a hydraulic connection exists. The larger the pressure and temperature perturbations and the area over which they act, the larger is the chance of affecting a critically stressed fault or bringing a fault to failure.  Operations in porous sandstone aquifers interbedded with clayrich layers far from the basement are less likely to generate felt seismic events as pressure changes are lower and a hydraulic connection to the basement is often less likely."
