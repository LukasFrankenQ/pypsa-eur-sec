- Basic idea: Confined geothermal reservoir can store accumulated, pressurized geofluid and provide flexible load-following generation.
- This flexible generation increases value of geothermal plants in markets high VRE penetration.
- A particular quality of EGS is that is naturally offers geomechanical energy storage through its low-permeability rock matrix.
- This behaviour was demonstrated by the Fenton Hill test site 
- Basic principle: Periodic reductions in production flow rate with no change in injection rate were shown to results in increased reservour pressure
- Referred to as __in-reservoir energy storage__ (IRES).
- Average cycle efficiency around 80 percent.

##### Mining the Earth's Heat: Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Energy (Fenton Hill summary)

- thermal power on the order of 4-5 MW
- at 180 degrees, 15 percent efficiency -> 0.5 MW of electricity
- Except in unusual areas where recent faulting hat disturbed the basement rock, the geology similar to Fenton Hill, allowing replication of the Fenton Hill reservoirs at 'tens of thousands of locations'.
- Main 2 takeaways: Central to HDR tech are 1) drilling deep enough for suitable temperatures, and 3) drilling into basement rock that is free of open joints -> better reservoir confinement.
- Rock structures accessed by EGS are harder in nature than the formations drilled into for oil and gas -> little incentive existed for drilling equipment for this setting.
- Backpressure applied to production wellbore induces energy storage

##### The Role of Flexible Geothermal Power in Decarbonized Electricity Systems
*Wilson Ricks, Katharine Voller, Jack Norbeck, Jesse Jenkins*
[working paper link](https://zenodo.org/record/7093330#.ZDUdrHZBxPY), paper in under review.

- Flexible EGS enhances the role that EGS plays in the overall system by decreasing bulk electricity supply cost
- Displaces more expensive competing resources by shifting their generation on diurnal and seasonal timescales.
- Round trip efficiencies of 81-98% percent are assumed.
- Robust across a range of electricity market and geothermal tech development scenarios.
- Use software ResFrac to similate operations and map reservoir pressure to flow rates.
- Model captures strong dependence of geothermal power output on local air temperature.
- __Results:__
    - Flexible EGS is competetive even without significant reductions in cost of wellfield or surface plants.
    - Reduction in drilling cost and advanced drilling to access resources at depth of up to 6.5 km are pathway to much greater EGS deployment; 45% of electricity from EGS for regions.
    - shifting generation to high-value times makes a great difference.
    - generation shifted over time scales of days to months.
    - During this, round-trip efficiencies of 81-98% are achieved.

##### The design space for long-duration energy storage in decarbonized power systems.
*Sepulveda et al. 2021* [nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-021-00796-8)

- Evaluates the role of long-duration energy storage in a decarbonized energy system
- Required cost and efficiency to displace firm low-carbon generation.
- Charge and discharge capacity play secondary roles, energy capacity costs must be \leq 20 USD/kWh, to reduce elec cost by >10%.
- must be \leq 1 USD/kWh to fully displace all firm low-carbon generation (i.e. fossil+CCS)
- Electrification of end uses in northern lats is difficult -> makes LDES unlikely to be feasible.
- LDES with most effect have storage durations >100h.
- Great table with cot overview for different storage methods
- electricity system cap expansion model with hourly resolution.
- Tested combinations of five different parameters: 
    - charge power capacity cost
    - discharge power capacity cost
    - energy storage capacity cost
    - charge efficiency
    - discharge efficiency
